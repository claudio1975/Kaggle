## Use Case: PowerCo

# Scenario:
Our client, PowerCo, is a major utility company providing gas and electricity to corporate, SME and residential
customers. In recent years, post-liberalization of the energy market in Europe, PowerCo has had a growing problem
with increasing customer defections above industry average. Thus PowerCo has asked us to work alongside them
to identify the drivers of this problem and to devise and implement a strategy to counter it. The churn issue is
most acute in the SME division and thus they want it to be the first priority. The head of the SME division has
asked whether it is possible to predict the customers which are most likely to churn so that they can trial a range
of pre-emptive actions. He has a hypothesis that clients are switching to cheaper providers so the first action to be
trialed will be to offer customers with high propensity of churning a 20% discount.

# Your task:
We have scheduled a meeting in one week’s time with the head of the SME division in which you will present our
findings on the churn issue and your recommendations on how to address it. You are in charge of building the model
and of suggesting which commercial actions should be taken as a result of the model’s outcome. The first stage is
to establish the viability of such a model.
